# Chat Tweaks

Project Zomboid Mod. Adds a selection of different chat message formats as well as fully customizable coloring of messages. It is designed to be non-intrusive and allows for individual theming on a per-player basis.

## New Chat Options

These options are found in the chat's cog menu.

- Message Theme: A small selection of inbuilt themes lets you change the way that messages are displayed, i.e. by replacing the [square brackets]: with <Minecraft's style>: or removing them altogether.
- Color Themes: Choose from some inbuilt themes or customize colors based on your individual preference.
- Name Preferences: Full Name, First Name only, or even an option to shorten the name down to its first name over time.

## New Commands

All new commands or changes to existing commands can be controlled through the Sandbox Settings.

- /me and /wme for emotes as well as whispered emotes (see Immersive Whispers below)
- /ooc and /oocg to post Out-Of-Character messages locally or globally.
- /scene and /sceneg to post messages without a visible author, e.g. to describe what's happening in the world. Can also be limited to admins only.

## Immersive Whispers

The Immersive Whispers sandbox setting optionally replaces the /w command with a distance-based whisper chat. Additionally, whispers can be set to be restricted to the room they were spoken in, preventing them from being heard through walls.

However, the room boundary check is fairly simple, so whispers will not transmit through open doors even if you would expect them to.

## Additional Credits

While this mod was developed entirely from scratch, it does make partial use of findings made by Buffy's RP Chat in regards to encoding additional data in chat messages.
