description=[h1]Immersive Whispers[/h1]
description=The Immersive Whispers sandbox setting optionally replaces the /w command with a distance-based whisper chat. Additionally, whispers can be set to be restricted to the room they were spoken in, preventing them from being heard through walls.
description=However, the room boundary check is fairly simple, so whispers will not transmit through open doors even if you would expect them to.
